I feel pretty confident answering these questions. Regular tests or quizzes would probably be easier than answering these assessment question, but I think that these assessment questions are more useful. They really test to see if you know a concept.

I think linters such as eslint will be the most useful to me. I'm really good at making typos, and having a program that checks for those typos will be really helpful. I also think prettier will help as well, because code formatting is not my strong suit. I don't like to take extra time to make sure everything is indented correctly.

Waterfall methodology is the proccess of working on a project in a specific order, so that requirements are met first- , then bug fixes and other are done later. Agile methodology tends to get important stuff done quicker, and show results quicker. For this project I think we used the agile methodology. The first thing we worked on was the visuals, the grid and colors. The last thing to get finished was the win detection(one of the requirements)
