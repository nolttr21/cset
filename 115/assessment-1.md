I think that if I just stick with the project I'm supposed to work on I'll get along just fine in the professional world. I expect the first couple months to be filled with many questions and google searches to figure out how to do certian things, but I'll get the hang of it eventually.

I could have a p element that would display the description for each room, outlining each of the hazzards and choices ect. I seems pretty easy to do this, just select the p element with a query selector and change the value of the text content variable to match the contents of whatever I would have passed to console.log.

Each data structure is unique, and each has its own places where it is most useful. The document object model (DOM for short) is an example of a tree data structure. Tree data structures are interesting because they can have so many different shapes, but contain the same data. The tree data structure is exactly like the file system on your computer, there are folders which contain other folders or files with contain other folders or files, or they could be empty folders, of there could be just files in a folder, ect. The same data exists no matter what shape the tree is in, but it can be buried pretty deep. DOM is the way html is structured. Since HTML often contains elements within elements, it makes sense to have the tree data structure, having everything in a list just wouldn't carry the same meaning.
