I think the most difficult part about working with a team will be communication with your team. Deciding who will work on what and other things seem like they could be a little difficult to work out. Even when you do figure it out, it can also be hard to make sure that edits you make won't break someone elses code.

A branch is a work space isolated from other work spaces and the official project. You can make edits to these branches and them push out these changes when you are finished. This could be useful if you need to work on two seperate features at the same time, but would be unable to test your changes with both features in progress at the same time. You could work on and test one feature, and when you want to work on the other feature you can, without needing to finish the other one. You can switch back and forth with ease. A remote is something that stores code, which all people working on the project use to base their code off of. When someone is finished with their changes, they push them to the remote, and everyone can download those changes.

For the colobrative project, I mostly used the centralized method. I downloaded his code, made changes to it, and the pushed my changes(well technicly it was a pull request)
